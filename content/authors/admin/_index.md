I am a fourth year student at University of Toronto studying CS and math. Since high school, my persuit has been to enable a autonomous vessel swarm to perform specific tasks including rubbish gathering, exploration, and environment monitoring. There are many key challenges for this goal, which span a wide range of research areas including autonomous driving, marine robotics, computer vision, and precision control. And these challenges motivates me to join different labs and projects for my undergraduate years. I am currently working with Prof. Wei Wang on control and planning algorithms of autonomous vessel and Prof. Nandita Vijaykumar on real-time 3d reconstruction.
